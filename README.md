# EBA3400_Project_Visualization_and_Analysis
This project is based upon an excel file 'holiday_homes_sample' which includes sample data regarding the location, price, id and other attributes of holiday houses in different municipalities in Norway.
The project includes, firstly, cleaning and merging of the data from the given file using pandas. As a result creating one single dataframe which shows all the attributes of the houses.
Secondly, an analysis of the prices of the holiday houses. Using plots such as bar plot, histogram and scatter plot to represent the data and figure out the averages and correlation between the data.
Lastly, using seaborn as a tool to create multivariate scatter plot, heat map and pair plot to show how the different attributes of the holiday homes are correlated.
